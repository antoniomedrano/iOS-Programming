# iOS Programming

This is my repo for learning how to make iOS apps with Swift using the book "iOS Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide (6th Edition)" ([book website](https://www.bignerdranch.com/books/ios-programming/))([amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/iOS-Programming-Ranch-Guide-Guides/dp/0134682335))

Note: the book is written in Swift v3.0, but the code here is in v3.1

I have also done some other Swift learning that is in the following repos:
